I realize one fatal flaw is that my rss writer doesn't do sorting (beyond the file naming scheme) so it doesn't rewrite the correct post order in the rss file.

To solve this without having to write something that sorts all the data, I'll just have the user be forced to name the files with YYYY-MM-DD-file-name.md which should be good enough? 

Well, it still has a flaw that if you have multiple posts in the same day it will resort to sorting them by the filename alphabetically after the date. I can live with that.

```js
const some_code = {"in","an","array"}
```
